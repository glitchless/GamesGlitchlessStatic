Second, you\u0027re going to need to be in ZPM to make the casings you need, full stop. You need a ZPM ABS for the components, so come back once you\u0027ve made a ZPM Energy Hatch.\n\nYou can probably figure most of it out on your own, but keep in mind that some of the materials need to be created in the ABS, solidified, macerated, and then used in another ABS recipe. Examples are: Hastelloy-N and Inconel-792.\n\nLaurenium is also like this, and also inclues Rhenium and Dysprosium. Rhenium uses a nonstandard ABS recipe to make, and Dysprosium requires either making Rare Earth (III) or going to the Toxic Everglades. You\u0027ll also need to make Rare Earth (I) for Ytterbium or, again, visit the Everglades for it.\n\nHave fun with that!\n\nÂ§3You\u0027ll almost certainly need more than this, but the exact amount, as always, depends on your hatches and busses."
