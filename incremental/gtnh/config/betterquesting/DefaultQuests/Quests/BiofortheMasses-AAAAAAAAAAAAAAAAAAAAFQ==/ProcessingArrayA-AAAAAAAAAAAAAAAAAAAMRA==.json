The Processing Array\u0027s only purpose is to receive singleblock machines that process materials, like a Macerator, Compressor, and many others. It can use up to 64 of one of those, and does their processing as if they were all running, allowing the inputs and outputs to be moved to one spot, and making a setup more compact and less laggy.\n\nFluid extracting Charcoal into Wood Tar is an example of a step that might want a Processing Array. Even though the recipe time isn\u0027t very high (much lower than it used to be), you can make it very fast with just one multi, even when using LV and MV machines to avoid wasteful overclocks. This applies to almost all kinds of processing, with the GT++ multis competing for the same role. Each of those is built differently, and has different requirements, so it\u0027s a good idea to check them all to see whether or not a PA is more worthwhile than they are."
