That said, there are about a dozen more with varying levels of usefulness.\n\nUnfortunately, the tiering of a GT++ multi doesn\u0027t always say how powerful it is. It is in our best interest that new multis are placed in good spots throughout progression, but there is a lot of old baggage that hasn\u0027t stood the test of time.\n\nAs a committed GTNH engineer, you can help uncover the true extent of what GT++ has to offer. You ought not to stop! "
