The quest with the jagged edges is a main quest and is linked to other main quests by a thick line. You must complete the main quests to unlock the next tier, or to progress in general. If you can\u0027t progress, go back to previous tiers and look for uncompleted main quests. The other quest is an optional quest, and is not needed to unlock new tiers. However, optional quests often introduce you to useful items or processes.\n\nWhat are the coins? You can use them to purchase things in the Coins tab. In case you started in a bad biome, I\u0027ll give you enough coins to purchase some saplings."
