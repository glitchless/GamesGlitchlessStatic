Backspace moves you back to the previously browsed recipe. \n\nHold Shift to stop the oredict cycling through items, and to show the oredict entries for the current item under your cursor.\n\nSearch using #oredict to find items that match that oredict; for example, #dyewhite will list all white dyes.\n\nUse * (asterisk) as a wildcard. For example #pipe*bronze will show you bronze pipes of all sizes.\n\nSearch using @mod. to find all items from that mod; for example, @mod.thaumcraft will list all thaumcraft items and blocks. Note that you need the whole name before it works.\n\nYou can even search a subset now with the right text. @mod.thaumcraft-\u003etable will search for anything with table in the name, in the mod thaumcraft. \n\n@thaumcraft and @thaumcraft-\u003e will also search for anything from the mod thaumcraft, but only if the name is set correctly on the tooltip of the item. They basically always are though.\n\nIt has even more advanced features than mentioned here, you should check the web for details. Or just play around with the options."
