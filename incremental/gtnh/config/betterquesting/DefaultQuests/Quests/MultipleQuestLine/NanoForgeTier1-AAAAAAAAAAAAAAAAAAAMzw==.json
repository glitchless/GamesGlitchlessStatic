There must be a better way.\n\nWhat about a Nano Forge, able to cut up blocks into nano-thin sheets and then creating the first nanite, which helps create thousands of them in mere seconds.\n\nÂ§3The Nano Forge is a big multiblock requiring lots of power over the course of a couple minutes. It is able to use TT energy hatches (including lasers). The controller must have a carbon nanite to use tier 1 recipes.\n\nDespite what NEI might claim there are no minimum voltages for the Nano Forge recipes. If you want to do a recipe you just have to achieve the raw EU/t required, no matter the voltage."
