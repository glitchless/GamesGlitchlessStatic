You can also use another mod like FTB Utilities, or even an external program. Try not to use more than one, or it\u0027ll just use up disk space and CPU power for no reason.\n\nIf you need to restore from a backup, the AB ones are found in the backups folder in the instance directory, not the world save directory.\n\nRemember though, JourneyMap and Thaumcraft Node Tracker information isn\u0027t included with AromaBackup, so you should backup your journeymap and tcnodetracker directories yourself if you don\u0027t trust them or are moving data to another drive or computer. Also, the Thaumcraft data is a little buggy, losing scanned aspect data and Thaumonomicon data, so consider backing up that file as well, the file is the \u0027saves\\\u003cworldname\u003e\\playerdata\\\u003cnameofplayer\u003e.thaum\u0027 file."
