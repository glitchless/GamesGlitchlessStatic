This will allow it to overclock like every other multi with 2xSpeed 4xEU/t.\n\nI will need to provide some distilled water to its hatch to avoid blockage in the pipes.\n\nÂ§3The Liquid Cooling Tower allows the Multiblock to have 2/4 OC at the cost of 10/s of distilled water when running. The hatch is placed in the center of the Liquid Cooling Tower."
