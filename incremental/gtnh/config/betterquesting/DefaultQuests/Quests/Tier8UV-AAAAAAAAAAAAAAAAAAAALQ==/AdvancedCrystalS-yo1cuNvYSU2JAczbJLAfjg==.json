As the demand for circuits quantities gradually increased, this method of production became untenable. Did we have a more advanced way to mass produce Crystal SoC?\n\nHere is a new material: Cerium-dropped Lutetium Aluminium Garnet (Ce:LuAG)\nThis LuAG has better performance in making Crystal SoC.(In fact it is a laser crystal material.) If you need a more faster speed of producing Crystal SoC, using LuAG to produce will be a good idea.\n\nFirst step mix Lutetium, Aluminium, Oxygen and a little Cerium to get the material Blend. Then put the blend with molten Lutetium into Autoclave to get the first gem type LuAG. If you have already got Oganesson you can also directly use Oganesson. And then use the gem LuAG and Blend to produce Exquisite gem LuAG in Autoclave.\n\nAfter get the first gem, you can also use Autoclave to grow crystals. Using Vacuum Furnance would be a better choice to produce Exquisite gem LuAG. Depends on your preference, of course.\n\nLutetium, Lutetium, it need a lot of Lutetium. How will you to get lot of Lutetium ? Thorium fission may be a little behind. What about \"§6Bee§r\"yond ? Or look at Lanthanides Nano Extraction ?"
