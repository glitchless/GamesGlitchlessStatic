This upgrade to the staff of traveling can move you even further, even faster, and will never run out of energy.\n\nRight-click:\n * If looking at a block: teleport to it, 512 range\n * If no block in range: teleport forward, 64 range\n * If looking at a block within 2 range: teleport to the other side of a wall, 16 range\n * No cooldown\n\nShift-right-click:\n * Teleport to travel anchor, 2048 range\n\n§3Tip: You won\u0027t be able to see travel anchors that are far away, but can still teleport to them if they are in range and chunk-loaded. Try using JourneyMap waypoints to mark anchors!\n\n§3Note: The staff of teleportation has inverted shift behavior compared to the regular staff. This is to make moving around with right-click easier."
