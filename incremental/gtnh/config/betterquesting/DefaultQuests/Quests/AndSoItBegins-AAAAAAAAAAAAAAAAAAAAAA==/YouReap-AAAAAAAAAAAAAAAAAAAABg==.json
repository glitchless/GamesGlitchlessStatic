As you\u0027ve created a hoe already, go and find some water nearby and make a field.  With this modpack you can only make farmland within range of water. Let\u0027s trade some sticks for a carrot, so you can start your own farm.\n\nTo get other wheat, use a hoe on grass away from water. You\u0027ll get Witchery seeds too, save those for later. Start planting a cotton field, it\u0027s a key early game resource.\n\n§3PS: You can also grab a bunch from villages, and also grow the seeds from Pam\u0027s garden food."
